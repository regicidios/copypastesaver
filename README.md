## About
copypastesaver is a CLI-based tool for Windows systems that upon execution generates a text file containing clipboard content.

## Dependencies
pywin32
```
pip install pywin32
```

## Setup
Add a desired filepath where you'd like the textfiles to be saved in functions.py. A directory named copypaste should be created here, with any text files generated through copypastesaver being saved inside.
